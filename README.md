# Graphs_Toolset
Algorithms and tool sets for graph computing and problem solving in graphs.

In this python program we test tools and algorithms we learned to solve problems presented on graphs.

# Algorithms currently implemented:
- BFS: Broad Forward Search
- DFS: Deep Forward Search
- Djikstra
- SCC: Strongly Connected Components 

# Functionality in the code:
- Present (un)weighted graphs in a dictionary representation.
- Create a graph using a user friendly prompt dialog
- Visualize a graph using matplotlib
- Modify graph: Transpose, remove nodes, create a copy..

# Assignment problems solved:
- Is there a shortest walk between X and Y that pass through Z
- Is there a shortest path between X and Y that pass through Z
- Do all the shortest paths between X and Y that pass through Z
- Is there a shortest walk between X and Y that pass through group A
- Is there a shortest path between X and Y that pass through group A
- What is the minimum value of the walk between X and Y that passes through Z

- Do 2 graphs with the same node group has the exact same topology sort?


# Misc
- GCD
- Create worded numbering
- Self test of functions
- Linked List
- AVL tree
